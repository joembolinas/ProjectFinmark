**Week 8: Responding to Network Challenges and Security Mitigation**

* **Weekly Goal: Submit Milestone 2 Draft 2 for Feedback**
  This week, your primary objective is to submit the second draft of your Milestone 2 refined project prototype for feedback. This submission is crucial as it demonstrates how your platform can evolve through testing and refinement, particularly in response to unexpected changes. The focus for Network & Cybersecurity specialists is to  **address a challenge scenario involving a sudden 300% traffic spike, implementing solutions to maintain network resilience and security under heavy load** . Your mentor's feedback on this draft will help assess your responsiveness to improving your work.
* **Approach and Key Decisions**
  To successfully address the challenge scenario of a significant traffic surge, your team will focus on several key network and cybersecurity strategies:
  * **Redesigning the Network for Resilience and Traffic Management** :
  * **Load Balancing:** This method distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to prevent any single server from becoming overloaded. For FinMark, which experiences system slowdowns during peak hours, load balancing is essential to ensure fast, reliable access and improved overall system performance. It also increases availability, as a load balancer can redirect traffic if one server fails, and supports scalability by allowing more servers to be added as demand grows. You can implement various types of load balancing, including application, network, global server, and DNS load balancing. Tools like HAProxy, Nginx, or pfSense can be used for this.
  * **Traffic Shaping and Quality of Service (QoS):** Network traffic refers to the flow of data packets across a network, including web requests, API calls, and file transfers. Traffic shaping controls this flow to reserve bandwidth for important data, while QoS prioritizes certain types of traffic (e.g., VoIP, checkout API calls) over others. This ensures that critical services receive the necessary bandwidth, especially during high-demand periods. For instance, a fintech platform might prioritize payday transactions.
  * **Firewall Rules and Segmentation:** A firewall acts as a security device that monitors and controls network traffic based on defined rules, serving as a first line of defense. FinMark's current network lacks a dedicated network firewall and exhibits a flat network structure, making it vulnerable to lateral movement of threats. Implementing a **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** and **Internal Firewalls** can protect the web server from attacks and prevent threats from spreading internally by segmenting internal traffic and isolating critical assets. **VLAN-based segmentation** can further separate client devices from sensitive systems like databases and web servers, reducing lateral attack risk.
  * **Handling Traffic Surges and Mitigating Attacks** :
  * **Rate Limiting:** This strategy controls the number of requests a user or IP address can make over a specific period, preventing a single user or script from overwhelming system resources. It is commonly applied to login attempts or API endpoints in financial platforms to prevent brute-force or bot attacks. For FinMark, this can mitigate service disruption from sudden traffic spikes.
  * **DDoS Mitigation:** Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are coordinated malicious efforts to overwhelm a system. Mitigation techniques include **blacklisting IPs** (blocking specific malicious IP addresses), **geo-blocking** (restricting access based on geographical location), or **rerouting traffic through Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)** to absorb the load. CDNs also reduce latency and improve website load times for remote users, offloading server strain.
  * **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS):** IDPS identify patterns in traffic that resemble known attack vectors. They either **alert administrators (detection)** or  **take automated action (prevention)** , such as dropping packets or blocking source IPs. For FinMark, IDPS would proactively monitor and protect the network from threats.
  * **Utilizing Secure Troubleshooting Techniques** :
  * **Preserving Confidentiality and Integrity:** Secure troubleshooting ensures that diagnosing and resolving network issues does not compromise the confidentiality or integrity of system data and access. This is critical for FinMark given its sensitive financial and marketing data.
  * **Secure Remote Access:** Administrators should use encrypted protocols like **SSH (Secure Shell)** or **VPN (Virtual Private Network)** to access systems remotely. This prevents credentials and commands from being exposed over the network. In fintech environments, remote access should also be audited for accountability.
  * **Logging and Auditing:** Every troubleshooting action, from restarting services to applying patches, should be recorded. This provides transparency and evidence for security reviews. **Auditd** is a tool for system activity auditing on Linux.
  * **Packet Analysis with Filters:** Tools like **tcpdump** or **Wireshark** can capture packet data. When troubleshooting, administrators should use filters (e.g., by IP, port, or protocol) to narrow down the issue, minimizing the risk of capturing or exposing sensitive information.
* **Problems Encountered and Solutions**
  The challenges to address during Week 8 directly relate to FinMark's existing pain points and security concerns:
  * **Mitigating traffic surges (whether legitimate spikes or DDoS attacks) to prevent service disruption:** FinMark's current system is overwhelmed by increasing demand, leading to performance degradation and instability. The project aims to handle projected demand of 3,000 orders per day, up from 500, and support a doubling of the customer base. Implementing load balancing, traffic shaping, rate limiting, and DDoS mitigation will directly address this, ensuring the system can perform under heavy load and avoid service interruption.
  * **Detecting and preventing unauthorized access or system overload:** FinMark has reported unauthorized access incidents, indicating weaknesses in its current security model, and experiences system slowdowns during peak hours, increasing vulnerability. Deploying IDPS, enhancing firewall rules, and implementing robust access controls are critical solutions.
  * **Ensuring confidentiality and integrity of system data during troubleshooting:** Given the sensitive financial and marketing data involved, secure troubleshooting techniques are paramount. This means using encrypted remote access, logging all actions, and filtering packet captures to prevent data exposure.
* **Tools Needed**
  The following tools will be instrumental in completing Week 8 tasks for Network and Cybersecurity specialists:
  * **ab (Apache Benchmark):** Used for **simulating traffic spikes** on a given endpoint.
  * **iptables:** A Linux command-line utility used to **apply basic rate limiting** and firewall rules.
  * **Snort:** An **IDPS** rule engine that identifies patterns in traffic resembling known attack vectors.
  * **SSH (OpenSSH):** Provides **secure remote terminal access** to systems, preventing credentials and commands from being exposed.
  * **tcpdump:** A lightweight command-line tool for  **packet capture with filters** , allowing diagnosis of network behavior while minimizing exposure of sensitive information.
  * **Auditd:** A system activity **auditing tool** on Linux, crucial for logging troubleshooting actions and maintaining traceability.
  * **Wireshark (with filters):** A GUI-based **packet inspection** tool that captures and inspects live packet data, providing deep visibility into various protocols. Filters allow focusing on relevant traffic (e.g., `ip.addr == 10.10.20.30 and tcp.port == 443`).
  * **Zabbix / Nagios Core:** **Monitoring and alerting platforms** that integrate with tools like SNMP to track network device performance, CPU load, and send alerts for failures or threshold breaches.
* **Output/Deliverables**
  By the end of Week 8, you are expected to deliver the following:
  * **Milestone 2 Draft 2 Submission:** This is the revised prototype based on previous feedback and the new challenge scenario.
  * **An updated network configuration:** This could include a revised `tc` script (for Linux traffic control), a `pfSense` setup (a firewall and routing platform), or updated `firewall rules` (e.g., `iptables` commands) that demonstrate effective traffic management under high load. This deliverable should include screenshots of monitored traffic or bandwidth patterns before and after QoS rules were applied, a summary of issues detected, specific actions taken, and observed outcomes.
  * **Conduct Peer Discussion #2:** This discussion is essential for team members to share insights, identify blockers, redistribute tasks if needed, and ensure accountability for progress.
* **Other Considerations**
  The **principle of least privilege** is a crucial security concept that dictates administrators should only use the minimum level of access required for any given task. For instance, a technician reviewing failed transaction logs should not have the ability to change routing tables. This principle is vital during secure troubleshooting to prevent accidental or malicious compromise of the system.
