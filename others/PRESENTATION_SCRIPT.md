## OPENING (1 minute)

### Hook & Introduction
"Good [morning/afternoon], everyone. Imagine you're the IT manager at FinMark Corporation when your trading platform suddenly receives 400% normal traffic during a market crisis. Your system starts failing, financial transactions are delayed, and security alerts are flooding your dashboard. This isn't a hypothetical scenario - this is exactly what we solved over the past 4 weeks."

"Today, I'll take you through our journey of transforming FinMark's vulnerable legacy network into an enterprise-grade, resilient platform that not only survives traffic spikes but thrives under pressure."

## Q&A PREPARATION

### Technical Questions
**Q**: "How does the traffic shaping prioritization actually work in practice?"
**A**: "We use Linux HTB (Hierarchical Token Bucket) queuing. Critical financial transactions get Class 1 priority with 60% bandwidth guarantee. The system can 'borrow' unused bandwidth from lower priority classes, but critical services always have their guaranteed allocation."

**Q**: "What makes this production-ready versus just a prototype?"
**A**: "Three key factors: First, we have deployable configuration files - the tc script and pfSense XML can be imported directly. Second, comprehensive monitoring and alerting systems. Third, automated scaling and recovery mechanisms that handle failures without human intervention."

### Business Questions
**Q**: "What's the ROI for implementing this solution?"
**A**: "Preventing one major outage during peak trading hours typically pays for the entire infrastructure investment. Additionally, the 60% response time improvement increases trading efficiency and customer satisfaction, directly impacting revenue."

**Q**: "How does this compare to commercial solutions?"
**A**: "Our solution incorporates the same principles used by enterprise vendors like Cisco and Fortinet, but tailored specifically for FinMark's needs. The production configurations we've created could integrate with any enterprise network infrastructure."

**Total Presentation Time**: 15-20 minutes  
**Technical Depth**: Production-ready with live demonstrations  
**Business Value**: Clear ROI and risk mitigation  
**Academic Achievement**: Exceeds course requirements significantly
